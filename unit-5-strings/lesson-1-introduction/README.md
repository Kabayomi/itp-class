# Introduction

Strings are everywhere. They can be as simple as `'Hello World'` or as complicated as parsing an old-latin text and transforming it to unicode.

The basics can be found [in the Basics chapter](https://python.swaroopch.com/basics.html), from [A Byte of Python](https://python.swaroopch.com/).

Some more advanced examples can be found in the [Strings chapter](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/thinkpython009.html) from [Think Python](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/index.html).

And finally, if you want to dig even more, we have built our own [Strings and Unicode guide](http://learn.rmotr.com/python/understanding-unicode-in-python/strings-and-unicode/introduction) which deals with complexities of Unicode and Byte strings.
