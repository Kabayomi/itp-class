# Fun-with-strings

Your task is to write a single line of code, that repeats the input string `s` 5 times. 

You are not required to know the concepts of `function` in python. All you need to know that the string that you have to work on is stored in a variable `s`. In your solution, you need to delete the comment next to the `return` statment and write your code there. 

**Note: It's important that `return` followed by your code are in one line**.

*Hint*: The solution to this assignment is a single line of code. 

examples:
- If `s` contains "\*" then your answer should be "*****"
- If `s` contains "hey" then your answer should be "heyheyheyheyhey"
- if `s` contains "*.*" then your answer should be "*.**.**.**.**.*"
