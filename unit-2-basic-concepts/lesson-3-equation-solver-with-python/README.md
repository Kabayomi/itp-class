## The slope equation. 

Let's say you have a line with two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). Your task is to find the slope `m` of the line whose points are (2, 3), (6, 7). The formula to calculate the slope of theline is:

You have to store your answer in the variable `m`


**Note: If you are not able to view the image of the equation: here is the equation: **
`m = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1)`
