# Conditional multiplication

Define a function `conditional_multiplication` that receives a boolean and a 
number and returns a number. If the boolean is True the number returned is 
multiplied by 10.

Examples:

```python
>>> conditional_multiplication(True, 2)
20
>>> conditional_multiplication(False, 5)
5
```
