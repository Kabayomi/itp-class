# user-input-until-exit

Define a function `user_input_until_exit` that continuously receives user input 
in a loop using the raw_input function until the user inputs 'exit'. There are
no unit tests for this assignment because it relies on user input so check
your work. 


Examples:

```python
>>> user_input_until_exit()
>>> this
>>> is
>>> a
>>> test
>>> exit
```
