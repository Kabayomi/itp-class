# Introduction to Programming with Python

Coding, as any other skill in life, is built upon experience. Would you say you can become a great basketball player by just watching the NBA? You probably wouldn't. In the same sense, you can't be a good programmer by watching programming videos or reading about programming languages. If you want to be a great programmer you have to sit down and start coding. There's not other way.

This course will take you through the fundamentals of programming building from the very basics (Data Types, Collections, Control Flow) and introducing you to more advanced concepts as Object Oriented Programming. To be able to take this course, **you're required to have some basic knowledge of programming**. So we can pick from there and take you to the next level. If you have no experience, we recommend you to start with [Programming for Everybody](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python) or the [Codecademy Python Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python).

## This course is perfect for you if:

* You've been reading about programming but you don't know the concepts of programming behind.
* You feel like you are not making progress. You want to code, but you don't know how to start.
* You get stuck easily and you don't know how to get unstuck, how to debug your error or find help.
* You need other people to surround you and encourage you to learn so you don't end up procrastinating.
